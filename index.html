           Hi, my name is Zaria Kathryn... <br>
           Im from little old Whanganui New Zealand, im Part Maori and im almost 19 years old and i am a first year student<br> at Massey Univirsity Collage of creative arts in Wellington.<br>  
           I am studying Design majoring in photography,  arts in general have been been one of my biggest passions in life for<br>about as long as i can remember ive been doing something creative.<br>
           Photography is definitly my strongest passion but I have always loved encoperating my photography into my designs <br>
           in any way possible, as you will see on my digital portfolio, I have been hugely influenced by my maori background <br>
           The design you see on this page is one of my more recent designs I produced for my university paper named "screen"<br>
           which stands for design via a you guessed it... screen. In short the brief for this was to create an image/collage that <br>
           potrays us as an artist and our mihi mihi.<br>
           Over on the "portfolio" page is a digitial portfolio of some of my works from over the years feel free to browse through. <br>
           Note that any of these works are avilable for purchase so do not hesatate to contact me for more information.<br>
           contact details can be found on the "contact" page along with all of my social media links.
